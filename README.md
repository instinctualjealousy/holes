Diggin, diggin. Mostly holes. When I'm done, I buries them again all neat and tidy. With Scoop manifests.<br />
This is a bucket (repository) for [Scoop](https://scoop.sh), the Windows command-line installer.

How do I join Doug on his conquest t... I mean, how do I install this bucket?
---------------------------------

To add this bucket, run `scoop bucket add holes https://github.com/instinctualjealousy/holes`. To install applications from this bucket, do `scoop install holes\<app>` or simply `scoop install <app>` if it doesn't exist on any other claimed buckets.
